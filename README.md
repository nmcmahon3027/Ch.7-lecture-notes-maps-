//Maps & the Map Interaface
A map is a set of ordered pairs
{(J, Jane), (B, Bill), (S, Sam)}
(key set, value set)

V.get (Object key) //If I give you the key you can get the value
V.put(K key, V value) //give you a key and a value associated w/ that key and 
                      //put it into the key and value sets
